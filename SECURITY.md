# Security

The OpenINF team takes the security of OpenINF and the applications created with
it seriously. This page describes how to report any vulnerabilities you may find
and lists best practices to minimize the risk of introducing a vulnerability.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

In the rare event that you find a vulnerability in the OpenINF SDK itself,
[email us](mailto:code@open.inf.is).

## Best practices

- **Keep current with the latest OpenINF SDK releases.** We regularly update the
  OpenINF SDK, and these updates may fix security defects discovered in earlier
  versions. Check the OpenINF SDK changelog for security-related updates.

- **Keep your application’s dependencies up to date.** Make sure you upgrade
  your package dependencies to keep the dependencies up to date. Avoid pinning
  to specific versions for your dependencies. If you do, make sure you check
  periodically to see if your dependencies have had security updates and update
  the pin accordingly.
