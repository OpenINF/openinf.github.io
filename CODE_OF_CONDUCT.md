# Code of Conduct

_Be excellent to each other._

We expect OpenINF community members to act professionally and respectfully, and
we expect our social spaces to be safe and dignified environments.

Specifically:

- Respect people, their identities, their culture, and their work.
- Be kind. Be courteous. Be welcoming.
- Listen. Consider and acknowledge people's points before responding.

If any OpenINF community member violates this code of conduct, maintainers may
remove issues, comments, PRs, or block accounts. There is a zero tolerance
policy to harassment even outside of public communication channels. If you are
subject to or witness unacceptable behavior or have any other concerns, please
[email us](mailto:code@open.inf.is).
