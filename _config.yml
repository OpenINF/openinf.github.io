# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This master configuration file contains global configurations and variable
# definitions that are meant for settings that affect the whole microsite with
# values that are expected to be set up once and that rarely need to be edited
# after that, which is why they are only read once at execution time.
#
# For technical reasons, changes made to this file are *NOT* reloaded
# automatically during automatic regeneration when using 'jekyll serve'. If
# you change this file, please restart the server process as changes are not
# loaded until the next execution.
#
# Note: Data Files _are_ included and reloaded during automatic regeneration.
#
# Site personalization settings accessed in templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
