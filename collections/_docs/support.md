Having trouble? Please consult these official resources in order of appearance.

## Resources

**[open.inf.is][docs-site] on the Web:** The OpenINF website. It has docs and
tutorial resources.

**[`#openinf`][matrix-channel] on matrix.org:** The OpenINF Matrix support
channel on the _matrix.org_ network. It’s a synchronous chat channel for
lightweight communication. It is good for asking questions, casual conversation,
collaboration, and quick exchanges. Be sure to follow our Code of Conduct. The
room is end-to-end encrypted, and you will need first to be verified before
messages can be seen (this is performed by in-room mods/admins). Invitation to
the space would have to happen before room verification can occur, but this
channel is now mostly defunct in favor of our Discord channel(s).

**[`#support`][support-channel-discord] in OpenINF Community Server Discord:**
The [`#support` channel][] on the OpenINF Community Server Discord is a
synchronous chat channel that provides a preferred communication venue. It is
suitable for asking questions. Casual conversation, collaboration, and/or other
quick exchanges would more appropriately occur in our [`#general` channel][].
Please use the [`#off-topic` channel][] for any other side
<abbr title="conversations">convos</abbr> that may need to take place. Be sure
to follow our Code of Conduct.

**[@OpenINF][x-twitter-account] on X (formerly Twitter):** The OpenINF Community
support account on X (formerly Twitter).
<abbr title="Direct Messages">DMs</abbr> (Direct Messages) remain open at all
times. Be sure to follow the new [X Rules][x-twitter-rules] (formerly Twitter
Rules) _and_ our Code of Conduct.
