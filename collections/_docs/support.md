### Resources

**[open.inf.is][docs-site] on the Web:** The OpenINF website. It has docs and
tutorial resources.

**[`#openinf`][matrix-channel] on matrix.org:** The OpenINF Matrix support
channel on the _matrix.org_ network. It’s a synchronous chat channel for
lightweight communication. It is good for asking questions, casual conversation,
collaboration, and quick exchanges. Be sure to follow our [Code of
Conduct][coc]. The room is end-to-end encrypted, and you will need first to be
verified before messages can be seen (this is performed by in-room mods/admins).
Invitation to the space would have to happen before room verification can occur,
but this channel is now mostly defunct in favor of our Discord channel(s).

**[`#support`][support-channel-discord] in OpenINF Community Server Discord:**
The [`#support` channel][] on the OpenINF Community Server Discord is a synchronous
chat channel that provides a preferred communication venue. It is suitable for asking
questions. Casual conversation, collaboration, and/or other quick exchanges would
more appropriately occur in our [`#general` channel][]. Please use the
[`#off-topic` channel][] for any other side <abbr title="conversations">convos</abbr>
that may need to take place. Be sure to follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].

**[@OpenINF][x-twitter-account] on X (formerly Twitter):** The OpenINF Community
support account on X (formerly Twitter).
<abbr title="Direct Messages">DMs</abbr> (Direct Messages) remain open at all
times. Be sure to follow the new [X Rules][x-twitter-rules] (formerly Twitter
Rules) _and_ our [Code of Conduct][coc].
