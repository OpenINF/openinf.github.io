# Hyphens

**Key Point:** Hyphenate words only when needed for clarity.

## Compound modifiers

Use hyphenated compound modifiers before a noun. A compound modifier acts as a
single unit to modify the noun. When you use a compound modifier after a noun,
don't hyphenate it.

## When to hyphenate

Don't hyphenate a word that has a prefix or suffix except in the following
situations:

- Where not doing so could cause confusion; for example, _re-count_, _re-mark_.
- When a number or a capital letter follows the prefix; for example,
  _non-English_, _pre-1500_, _post-twelfth graders_.
- When the prefix ends in a vowel, and the word it precedes starts with the same
  vowel; for example, _co-op_, _de-energize_.
- When the prefix is _self_; for example, _self-aware_, _self-important_.
- When the prefix is followed by a word that is already hyphenated.
- When the prefix is followed by a compound word that contains a space. In this
  case, the space is replaced with a hyphen; for example, _twentieth century_
  but _pre-twentieth-century music_.

## Compound words

Compound words are two or more words that are joined to form a new word. To
determine whether to hyphenate a compound word, check the
[word list](word-list.md). If it's not in the word list, check a dictionary.

## Range of numbers

Use a hyphen to indicate a range of numbers. Don't add words such as _from_ or
_between_.

#### Examples

Not recommended: from 8-20 files

Recommended: 8-20 files

## Spaces around hyphens

Never place a space on either side of a hyphen except when using a
[suspended hyphen](hyphens.md#suspended-hyphens), in which case you can leave a
space after (but not before) the hyphen.

## Suspended hyphens

When two or more compound modifiers have a common base, you can keep the hyphens
but leave out the base for all except the last modifier. In the following
example, the base is "hour."

#### Example

Recommended: You can set up the system to scan for new files at one-, two-, or
three-hour intervals.

**Note:** Hyphens are not dashes; don't use them interchangeably. For
information about dashes, see [Dashes](dashes.md).
