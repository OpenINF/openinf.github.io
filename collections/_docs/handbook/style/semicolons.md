# Semicolons

**Key Point:** Use semicolons to separate independent clauses.

Where to use semicolons is often a matter of judgment. Use them judiciously.

## Between two independent clauses

Use a semicolon between two closely related independent clauses that are not
quite unrelated enough to merit a period, but where a comma isn't quite enough.

#### Examples

Recommended: The Earth Engine image must have exactly one or three bands when
exporting to GME; other images cause the export to fail.

Recommended: You can easily test compatibility by computing the centroid; if it
is on the opposite side of the planet, reverse the order of your vertices.

## Before a conjunctive adverb

A semicolon precedes a conjunctive adverb that joins two independent clauses.
Conjunctive adverbs include the following: accordingly, also, besides,
consequently, furthermore, hence, however, indeed, in fact, likewise, similarly,
therefore, and thus. For a longer list of conjunctive adverbs, scroll to the

#### Examples

Recommended: The style of this button is up to you; however, you must still
follow branding guidelines.

Recommended: This setup places the head-tracked node below the Main Camera;
therefore, only the stereo cameras are affected by the user's head motion.

## Before an independent clause

A semicolon may appear before an independent clause that is introduced by a
phrase such as "that is," "for example," "namely," and so on.

#### Examples

Recommended: The next polling interval to use; that is, the number of seconds
before the client should contact the server again.

Recommended: The URL from which a video ad loads; that is, the URL to use to
fetch that video ad.

## Between complex items in a series

When you have a series of long or complex items, such as items that themselves
contain punctuation, use semicolons, rather than commas, as separators.

#### Examples

Recommended: If you don't have time, then focus on the improvements that will
have the greatest benefit: what matters most to your users; what is most
important to fix; and what is easy or feasible to fix in the available time.

Recommended: Review your document one more time, checking for the following:
present tense and active voice; typos, punctuation, and grammar; and whether you
can shorten anything.

Notice that in the final example, the second item in the list is itself a list.
