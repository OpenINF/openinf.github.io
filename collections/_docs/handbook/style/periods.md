# Periods

**Key Point:** End a complete sentence with a period, unless it's a question.

## Periods with lists

Whether to end a list item with a period depends on several factors, including
the kind of list that the item appears in.

For more information about lists, see [Lists](lists.md).

### Description lists

Don't put a period at the end of a term. (That is, at end of an item in a `<dt>`
element.)

Do put a period at the end of a description. (That is, at the end of an item in
a `<dd>` element.)

### Bulleted lists

In general, use a period at the end of each item in a bulleted list. Exceptions:
single-word items; items entirely in code font; items with no verbs. For more
information, see
[Capitalization and end punctuation](lists#capitalization-and-end-punctuation.md)
in the Lists page.

### Numbered lists

Use the same guidelines as for bulleted lists (above).

## Periods with URLs

When a period immediately follows a URL (or a file path), it can be hard to tell
whether the period is part of the URL.

To indicate that the punctuating period isn't part of the URL, try one of the
following techniques:

- Whenever possible, avoid putting [URLs in text](link-text.md).
- Rewrite the sentence so that the URL isn't at the end of the sentence.
- Put the URL on a separate line from the text, omitting the final period.

If the URL is a link, it generally looks different from surrounding text. For
example, in most browsers, link text is blue by default. This formatting helps
distinguish the URL from the period.

**Note:** When you do put a period after a URL, don't leave any space between
the last character of the URL and the period.

## Periods with quotation marks

When a sentence ends with material inside quotation marks, place the period
inside the quotation marks even if the period isn't part of the material inside
the quotation marks.

If the material inside the quotation marks ends with a question mark or an
exclamation point, don't use a period.

#### Examples

Recommended: ... in front of a vowel sound, use "an."

Recommended: Children always ask "Why?"

For more information about quotation marks, see
[Quotation Marks](quotation-marks.md).

## Periods with parentheses

If the last part of a sentence is contained inside parentheses, put the period
after the closing parenthesis.

If the parentheses contain a complete sentence, put the period inside the
parentheses.

#### Examples

Recommended: Your application could show a notification when a relevant file or
folder has changed (even if that change occurs while your application isn't
running).

Recommended: App Engine applications are easy to create, easy to maintain, and
easy to scale. (With App Engine, there are no servers for you to maintain.)

For more about parentheses, see [Parentheses](parentheses.md).

## Periods with headings

Don't end headings with periods.

For more information about headings, see [Headings](headings.md).

## Periods with numbers

Use a period to represent a decimal point.

For more information about numbers, see [Numbers](numbers.md).

## Periods with captions

In general, don't use periods with captions. For more information, see
[Figures](images#text-associated-with-images.md).

## Periods with abbreviations

Put a period after a shortened word.

Don't put periods after the letters of an acronym or initialism.

For more information about abbreviations, see [Abbreviations](abbreviations.md).
