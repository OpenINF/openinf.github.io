# Contractions

**Key Point:** In general, it's OK to use contractions; but be wary of certain
kinds of contractions.

Because we write our documentation in an informal [tone](tone.md), feel free to
use most types of contractions.

## Negation contractions

In particular, it's fine to use "-n't" contractions, such as "isn't," "don't,"
and "can't."

One reason that such contractions are useful: it's sometimes easy for a reader
to miss the word "not," whereas it's harder to misread "don't" as "do."

## Noun+verb contractions

In general, avoid contractions formed from nouns and verbs.

#### Examples

Not recommended: The browser's fast, simple, and secure.

Recommended: The browser is fast, simple, and secure.

The second example above is better because using _'s_ in place of _is_ could
cause the reader to think that "browser's" is the possessive form.

In some cases, it's OK to use a noun+verb contraction, such as "If you want to
display information, a table's your best option." But in general, it's best to
avoid that kind of contraction.

#### Examples

Not recommended: The following guides're a good way to learn to use Universal
Analytics.

Recommended: The following guides are a good way to learn to use Universal
Analytics.

Here, "guides're" just sounds clunky and weird.

## Don't use double contractions

Double contractions contain not just one but two contracted words. Some examples
of double contractions are as follows:

- mightn't've (mightn't have → might not have)
- mustn't've (mustn't have → must not have)
- wouldn't've (wouldn't have → would not have)
- shouldn't've (shouldn't have → should not have)

## Its and it's

Don't confuse _its_ with _it's_. It's just not right!
