# Abbreviations

**Key Point:** Use standard American abbreviations. Avoid internet slang.

Abbreviations include acronyms, initialisms, shortened words, and contractions.

- An acronym is formed from the first letters of words in a phrase, but is
  pronounced as if it were a word itself:
  - _NATO_ for _North Atlantic Treaty Organization_.
  - _scuba_ for _self-contained underwater breathing apparatus_.
- An initialism is also formed from the first letters of words in a phrase, but
  each letter is pronounced separately:
  - _CIA_ for _Central Intelligence Agency_.
  - _FYI_ for _For Your Information_.
  - _PR_ for _Public Relations_.
- A shortened word is just part of a word or phrase, sometimes with a period at
  the end:
  - _Dr._ for _doctor_.
  - _etc._ for _et cetera_.
  - _min_ for _minutes_.
  - _CA_ for _California_.
- [Contractions](contractions.md) are discussed in a separate page of this style
  guide.

There's some overlap among those categories. In particular, some abbreviations
can be either acronyms or initialisms, depending on the speaker's preference;
examples include _FAQ_ and _SQL_. In some cases, the pronunciation determines
[whether to use "a" or "an."](articles.md)

## Long and short versions of a word

Some words have a long version and a short version. Examples include:

- _application_ and _app_
- _demonstration_ and _demo_
- _synchronize_ and _sync_

The short versions of the words are not abbreviations, and if you use them, you
don't need to put a period after them.

If you're not sure whether a word is an abbreviation or just a short version of
a longer word, look in our list of [resources](resources.md). If that doesn't
settle the issue, use the speaking test: if you speak the short version as a
word ("This is a demo version of the product"), you can usually treat it as a
word and not an abbreviation.

## When to spell out a term

In general, when an abbreviation is likely to be unfamiliar to the audience,
spell out the first mention of the term in the text (not in a heading) and
immediately follow with the abbreviation, in parentheses. For all subsequent
mentions of the abbreviation, use the abbreviation by itself.

When deciding to spell out a term, consider your audience. If the majority of
your audience is likely to recognize and understand the term, then you don't
need to spell it out. For example, if you're writing documentation for
developers that references an API, you don't need to spell out _application
programming interface_. However, if you're explaining the general concept of an
API to someone with no programming experience, spelling out the abbreviation can
be helpful.

In some cases, spelling out a term doesn't help the reader understand the term.
For example, writing out _portable document format_ doesn't help the reader
understand what a _PDF_ document is. In those cases, don't spell out the term.

The following abbreviations rarely need to be spelled out:

- API
- DVD
- File formats such as PDF or XML
- HTML
- PC
- RAM
- REST
- [Units of measurement](units-of-measure.md) such as _MB_ or _GB_
- URL
- USB

## Abbreviations not to use

Prefer English terms over Latin abbreviations. Don't use "i.e." or "e.g.";
instead, use "that is" or "for example," respectively. One exception: it's
[okay to use "etc." in some circumstances](word-list.md#etc).

Don't use internet slang abbreviations such as "[tl;dr](word-list.md#tldr),"
"[ymmv](word-list.md#ymmv)," "[RTFM](word-list.md#rtfm)," or others. Write out
what you mean in a non-figurative way.

Use the most common form of a word. If the full spelled-out word is common and
easily understandable, use that rather than abbreviating. For example, write
"approximately" instead of "approx."

## Periods with abbreviations

Follow these guidelines:

- Don't use periods with acronyms or initialisms.
- Put a period at the end of a shortened word, except for
  [date and time](dates-times.md) abbreviations.
- If you write or say an abbreviation as a word (for example, "app" or "sync"),
  don't put a period after it.
- Don't use a period with an abbreviation for the name of a country, US state,
  or the District of Columbia (DC).
