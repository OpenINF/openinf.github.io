# Capitalization

**Key Point:** Use standard American capitalization. Use sentence case for
headings.

In text, follow the standard
[capitalization rules](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/mechanics/help_with_capitals.md)
for American English. Additionally:

- Don't use all-uppercase for emphasis.
- Avoid [camel case](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) and
  [all caps](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps). Some screen readers read
  capitalized letters individually, and some languages are
  [unicase](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicase).
- Follow the official capitalization for the names of brands, companies,
  software, products, services, and terms defined by companies and open source
  communities. For example, if you're using Kubernetes-related terms, then
  follow the capitalization shown in the Kubernetes
  [Concepts documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/).

Recommended: A Job creates one or more Pods

Recommended: The Cloud Scheduler job publishes a message to a Cloud Pub/Sub
topic at one-minute intervals.

**Note:** For information on how to capitalize specific words, see the
[word list](word-list.md).

## Capitalization in titles and headings

In document titles and page headings, use sentence case. That is, capitalize
only the first word.

**Exceptions:**

- For proper nouns, trademarks, keywords, and other terms that are always
  capitalized a certain way, use the standard capitalization for the term,
  regardless of where it appears in the title or heading.
- If you use a colon in a heading, treat what follows the colon as a separate
  heading, with an initial capital letter of its own.

Even though you're using sentence case, don't put a period at the end of a
heading.

**Note:** For more about headings and titles, in particular Android headings and
titles, see [Headings and titles](headings.md).

## Capitalization and colons

Use a lowercase letter to begin the first word of the text immediately following
a colon, unless the text is one of the following:

- A proper noun (_Open source software: Istio_).
- A quotation (_Arthurian wit: "Bring me yon sworde"_).
- An item in a bulleted, numbered, or definition listâ€”for example:
  - _Descriptive analytics: Analyzing real-time and historical data to
    understand past behaviors._
- Text that follows a label, such as _Caution_ or _Note_.
- A subheading on the same line as a heading (_Migrating to INF: Best
  practices_).

## Capitalization and figures

Use sentence case for captions and other figure-related text.

## Capitalization in glossaries and indexes

Use lowercase for glossary and index terms unless the term is a proper noun or
has another reason to require capitalization.

Use sentence case for glossary definitions.

## Capitalization and hyphenated words

When a hyphenated word is the first word in a sentence or in a heading,
capitalize only the first element in the word, unless a subsequent element is a
proper noun or proper adjective.

## Capitalization in lists

Use sentence case for items in all types of lists.

## Capitalization for tables in text

Use sentence case for all the elements in a table: contents, headings, labels,
and captions.
