# Quotation marks

**Key Point:** Use straight double quotation marks and apostrophes.

## Commas and periods with quotation marks

Commas and periods go inside quotation marks, in the standard American style,
despite it being inconsistent with the way things are done in code, and
inconsistent with the standard British style.

#### Examples

British: See the section titled "Care and feeding of the emu".

American (and Google): See the section titled "Care and feeding of the emu."

**Exception:** When you put a keyword or other literal string in quotation
marks, put any other punctuation outside the quotation marks. In those cases,
the quotation marks indicate an exact literal string, so don't add anything
extraneous inside the quotation marks. But in general, don't put quotation marks
around an item that's in code font, unless the quotation marks are part of the
item.

#### Examples

Not recommended: If you enter "foo," the program crashes.

Better: If you enter "foo", the program crashes.

Recommended: If you enter foo, the program crashes.

**Note:** Literal-minded tech people are often resistant to the American style,
on the grounds that it's illogical. However, despite its illogic, the American
style shows no sign of going away, even in technical publications; if you look
at 100 books published by major American publishers (even technical books),
chances are good that at least 99 of them use the American style. For example,
in early 2017, recent O'Reilly and Apress books that we looked at still use the
American style.

## Straight and curly quotation marks

Most typefaces support two forms of quotation marks and apostrophes: straight
marks and "curly" or "typographic" marks. Some tools, like Google Docs,
automatically convert straight quotation marks and apostrophes to the curly
versions as you type. However, our guidance is to always use straight quotation
marks and straight apostrophes, for these reasons:

- It's easy to get the direction of curly quotation marks (especially
  apostrophes) wrong. Using straight marks avoids this problem.
- Code _requires_ straight marks.
- Many writers use coding tools (for example, Subversion) for working directly
  with markup. Because these tools do not produce curly marks by default, the
  writer must manually insert the marks, which is error prone.

#### Examples

Not recommended: The section’s title is “Care and feeding of the emu.”

Recommended: The section's title is "Care and feeding of the emu."

## Single quotation marks

The only times to use single quotation marks in our documentation are the
following:

- In code examples, in languages that use single quotation marks.
- When nesting a quotation inside another quotation.

In the latter case, put the primary speaker's quote in double quotation marks
and the quote inside the primary speaker's quote in single quotation marks, in
the standard American style. (This is opposite to the standard British style.)

#### Examples

British: She said, 'I heard him shout "Help", and saw him floundering in the
water.'

American (and Google): She said, "I heard him shout 'Help,' and saw him
floundering in the water."
