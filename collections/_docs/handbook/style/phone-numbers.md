# Phone numbers

**Key Point:** Format phone numbers using standard formats.

## Phone numbers in examples

Most phone numbers in our documentation are examples. For information about what
phone numbers to use in examples, see
[Example phone numbers](examples#phone-numbers.md).

## Formatting real phone numbers

In the rare case when you're providing a real phone number to contact a real
person, use the following formats, depending on whether the number is in North
America or elsewhere.

### North American phone numbers

To format phone numbers in the USA, Canada, and other
[NANP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan) (North
American Numbering Plan) countries, enclose the area code in parentheses
followed by a space, and then hyphenate the three-digit exchange code with the
four-digit number.

#### Example

Recommended: (415) 555-0132

### International phone numbers

To format phone numbers in non-NANP countries, include the country and area
codes. Separate the groups of numbers with spaces. Insert a plus sign
immediately before the country code (no space); the plus sign stands in for a
prefix known as an _exit code_, which lets you dial out of a country. Each
country has a different exit code.

For more information, see the
[ITU document on standardized formatting for phone numbers](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.123-200102-I/en).

#### Example

Recommended: +1 415 555 0132
