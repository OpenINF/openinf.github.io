# Pluralizing a single letter

**Key Point:** Pluralize a single letter by adding apostrophe-_s_.

To form the plural of a single letter, italicize the letter and add an
apostrophe followed by the unitalicized letter _s_.

Recommended: We called tech support because the printer wasn't printing
uppercase _B_'s or lowercase _p_'s.

When the capitalization is irrelevant, use uppercase.

Recommended: Mind your _P_'s and _Q_'s.
