# Words as words

**Key Point:** In general, use italics for drawing attention to words and
phrases as words in your content.

When you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase in your
documentation, because you're referring to it as the word or term itself, use
italics.

Not recommended: Don't use **&** (ampersand) as a conjunction. Use the word
**and** instead.

Recommended: Don't use _&_ (ampersand) as a conjunction. Use the word _and_
instead.

When you need to refer to letters as letters, use italics.

Not recommended: To form a possessive of a singular noun, add "'s" to the end of
the word.

Recommended: To form a possessive of a singular noun, add _'s_ to the end of the
word.
