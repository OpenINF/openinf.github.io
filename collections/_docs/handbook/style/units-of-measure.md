# Units of measurement

**Key Point:** Put a nonbreaking space between the number and the unit.

## Spaces in units of measurement

For most units of measurement, when you specify a number with the unit, use a
nonbreaking space between the number and the unit. This guidance applies in both
HTML and Markdown.

For guidance on when to spell out units, see the
[Abbreviations](abbreviations.md#spelling-out) page.

However, when the unit of measure is money or percent or degrees of an angle,
don't use a space. See also [Currency](units-of-measure.md#currency).

For degrees of temperature, don't use a space before the degree symbol, but do
use a nonbreaking space between the degree symbol and the abbreviation for the
temperature scale (_F_ or _C_). For Kelvin temperatures, leave out the degree
symbol but use a nonbreaking space before the _K_.

## Ranges of numbers with units

In a range of numbers, repeat the unit for each number.

Use the word _to_ between the numbers, rather than a hyphen. A hyphen can be
misinterpreted as a subtraction sign.

Not recommended: -40-85° C

Recommended: -40° C to 85° C

## Using _k_ to indicate thousands

In some contexts, it may be appropriate to indicate thousands of something by
following a number with a lowercase _k_. If you do that, then follow these
guidelines:

- Don't put a space between the number and _k_.
- Add a noun to indicate what the number measures, and to make clear that you're
  not using _k_ as an abbreviation for _kilobytes_.

## Currency

If you're writing about monetary amounts, make sure the reader knows what
currency you're referring to. For example, the dollar sign—the _\$_ symbol—can
refer to US dollars, Canadian dollars, Mexican pesos, and several other
currencies.

If there's any possibility of ambiguity, use a currency indicator before the
amount. For details, see section 9.20 and following in the Chicago Manual of
Style, 17th edition.
