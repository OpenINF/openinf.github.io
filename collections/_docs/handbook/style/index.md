# INF developer documentation style guide

**Key Point:** Use the guide as a style reference when writing developer
documentation.

This style guide provides a set of editorial guidelines for anyone writing
developer documentation for INF-related projects.

## Goals and audience

The guide codifies and records style decisions made by those in our Developer
Relations group so that you can write documentation consistent with our other
documentation.

### Non-goals

The guide doesn't apply to all INF documentation. If you already follow your own
style guide, then you can continue using it.

The guide isn't intended to provide an industry documentation standard, nor to
compete with other well-known style guides. It's a description of our house
style, not a statement that our decisions are objectively correct.

The guide isn't intended to provide a complete set of writing guidelines. For
example, it doesn't cover parts of speech, subject-verb agreement, or other
writing basics.

The guide is a living document, so it changes over time. When it changes, we
generally don't change previously published documentation to match. We strive
for consistency when feasible, but our style guide will not always match other
parts of our documentation. When in doubt, follow the guide rather than
imitating existing, potenitally outdated documents.

The guide doesn't provide legal advice, which is outside of its scope. Consult
your lawyers for issues relating to legal matters. In particular, the guidelines
in this document don't limit the changes that INF can make to its documentation.
Also, if you don't read a given guideline, then that doesn't absolve you from
behaving ethically and lawfully with regard to documentation.

## How to use the guide

If you're looking for a specific topic, then do a search-in-page to see if the
topic is mentioned in the left navigation bar. You can also use the search box,
which is limited by default to only search the guide.

The guide is a reference document. Instead of reading through it in linear
order, you can use it to look up specific issues as needed.

If you're new to the style guide and want to get a general sense of what our
style is, then see the [highlights](highlights.md) page.

For issues not covered in the guide, see the guides listed in
[other editorial resources](resources.md).

## Breaking the "rules"

Remember that everything in the guide is a guideline, not a draconian rule. In
most contexts, INF has no ability nor desire to enforce these guidelines if
they're not appropriate to the context. But we hope that you'll join us in
striving for high-quality documentation. A relevant quotation:

> "Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous."
>
> â€”George Orwell,
> "[Politics and the English Language](http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/)"

Like most style guides, our style guide aims to improve our documentation,
especially by improving consistency. Therefore, there might be contexts where it
makes sense to diverge from our guidelines in order to make your documentation
better.
