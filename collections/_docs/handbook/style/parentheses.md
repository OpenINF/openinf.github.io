# Parentheses

**Key Point:** Use parentheses judiciously.

Some of us love to use parentheses. Unfortunately, some readers ignore anything
that appears in parentheses, so don't put important information in parentheses
if you can help it.

And even for less important information, whenever you're inclined to use
parentheses, consider whether they're necessary. Sometimes they are; but
sometimes the sentence or paragraph works just as well if you remove the
parentheses and set off the phrase or sentence using commas, dashes, semicolons,
or periods.

**Note:** If a full standalone sentence appears inside parentheses, the period
also goes inside the parentheses, not outside.
