# Product names

**Key Point:** Use full Google product names where feasible, rather than
abbreviating them.

A few notes about product names.

## Shortening Google product names

When referring to a Google product, sometimes you might want to abbreviate the
product name. For example, when you're referring to Google Spreadsheets, it can
be awkward to refer to it as Google Spreadsheets every time; sometimes you might
want to call it Spreadsheets.

Use the full trademarked product name. Don't abbreviate product names except for
cases where you are following the UI or are limited by space constraints (as in
a table heading). In that case, make it clear that you're talking about the
Google product and not some other thing with a similar name.

If you use a product name as a modifier, pay close attention to which article
precedes the product name. For example, consider _Anthos Service Mesh_ (the long
name) and _Service Mesh_ (the short name). You would write _an Anthos Service
Mesh environment_, but _a Service Mesh environment_.

## Possessives of product names

For information about forming possessives with product names, see
[Company- and product-name possessives](possessives.md#company--and-product-name-possessives).

## Using "the" with product names

Don't use "the" before a product name unless you're using the name to qualify
something else. _Do_ use "the" before tool and API names.

## Multiple products

It's OK to refer to Google products as services, such as _the Google Kubernetes
Engine service_ or _the Compute Engine service_. However, if the term _services_
leads to ambiguity, use the product names.
