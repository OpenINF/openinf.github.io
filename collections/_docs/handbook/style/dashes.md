# Dashes

**Key Point:** When you need a dash, use an em dash.

To indicate a break in the flow of a sentence—or an interruption—use an em dash,
also known as a long dash. Don't put a space before or after it.

You can type the em dash character in various ways, depending on your platform:

macOS

Press Option+Shift+hyphen.

Linux desktop environment

Enable the Compose key. (Instructions for doing that vary depending on your
flavor of Linux; for examples, see
[Linux Keyboard Shortcuts For Text Symbols](http://fsymbols.com/keyboard/linux/compose/).)
After the Compose key is enabled, you can create an em dash by typing the
Compose key followed by three hyphens.

Alternatively, press Control+Shift+u, then let go of those keys, then type 2014,
then press Return.

Note: These Linux options don't work if you're signed in to the Linux command
line from a remote system using ssh or the like; you have to be in a Linux
desktop environment.

Windows

Turn num lock on, then hold down the left Alt key and type 0151 on the numeric
keypad.

Don't use an en dash (the shorter dash) or a hyphen in place of an em dash. The
use of " – " (an en dash with spaces around it) in place of an em dash is
gradually becoming more common, but it's still not very widespread in the US in
professional publishing; so far (as of early 2016), it's mostly used in Canada
and a couple of other places. For now, just use the em dash.

## Colons instead of dashes in lists

Another common but nonstandard construction is to use a hyphen surrounded by
spaces to separate an item and its description. Instead, use an HTML
[description list](lists.md) (`<dl>`) or, in some cases, a colon.

#### Examples

Not recommended: `example - This is an example.`

Better: `example: This is an example.`

Recommended for a series of items:

<dl>
  <dt>example</dt>
  <dd>This is an example.</dd>
  <dt>another example</dt>
  <dd>This is another example.</dd>
</dl>
