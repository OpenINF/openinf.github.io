# Articles (a, an, the)

**Key Point:** Include definite and indefinite articles in your documentation,
and use them correctly.

For ease of comprehension and translation, include _a_, _an_, and _the_ in your
writing.

_A_ and _an_ are indefinite articles and are used before a singular noun. They
refer to any member of a group.

_The_ is a definite article. It is used before singular and plural nouns and
refers to one or more particular members of a group.

Whether to use "a" or "an" depends on the pronunciation of the word that follows
it. Use "a" before any consonant sound; use "an" before any vowel sound.

#### Examples

- An hour
- An HTML file
- A hand
- A hotel
- An umbrella
- A union

To complicate matters further, some abbreviations can be both acronyms and
initialisms, requiring _a_ in one instance and _an_ in the other. For example,
_FAQ_, which some pronounce "fak" and others spell out, requires _an_ when
spelled out and _a_ when pronounced as a word. The following is a list of these
kinds of abbreviations with our recommendations for which article to use:

- An SQL (database)
- An FAQ
