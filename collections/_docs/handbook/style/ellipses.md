# Ellipses

**Key Point:** In general, don't use ellipses.

_Ellipses_ is the plural of _ellipsis_. An ellipsis is made up of three
contiguous periods. (Technically, the dots in an ellipsis are ellipsis points,
but for our purposes, you can think of them as periods.) Ellipses indicate the
omission of part of a sentence, paragraph, or larger block of text where the
omission is not pertinent to the understanding of the subject at hand.

## Suspension points

When ellipses are used to indicate hesitation, they are called _suspension
points_. Don't use ellipses this way in our documentation.

**Example:**

Not recommended: The answer is ... wait for it ... that you shouldn't do this.

## How to use ellipses

In a user interface

When ellipses appear in a user interface, exclude them from the documentation
describing the user interface unless their omission could cause confusion. For
example, if the text on the button in the UI reads "Save ...", document it as
"click **Save**".

In text

Don't use ellipses in your written documentation; omit any unnecessary
information and include all necessary information.

However, it's acceptable to use ellipses in quoted text (to replace a portion of
the quoted text) except when they appear at the beginning or end of the text.

**Examples:**

Not recommended: My high school English teacher made me learn that Shakespeare
quote about all the world being a stage and " ... all the men and women merely
players."

Not recommended: My high school English teacher made me learn that Shakespeare
quote: "All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players ...."

The previous example ended with four ellipsis points. The final ellipsis point
is, in fact, a period. So when the material that you're omitting contains one or
more sentence boundaries, use four dots instead of three.

**Example:**

Recommended: My high school English teacher made me learn that Shakespeare
quote: "All the world's a stage, ... And one man in his time plays many parts."

Punctuation and spacing

Keep all three ellipsis points together. When creating an ellipsis, instead of
the ellipsis character use three periods in a row. Insert one space before and
after the ellipsis unless a punctuation mark immediately follows the ellipsis;
in this case, don't insert a space after the ellipsis.

**Examples:**

Not recommended: You don't need to understand all the other Python code in
there...we'll explain it all in class.
