# Slashes

**Key Point:** Avoid using slashes except in file paths and URLs.

## Slashes with dates

Don't use date formats that rely on slashes.

For information about how to write dates, see [Dates and Times](dates-times.md).

## Slashes with alternatives

Don't use slashes to separate alternatives.

## Slashes with file paths and URLs

Use forward slashes, as appropriate, in computer file paths and URLs.

**Note:** If you're documenting a Windows path, use backslashes.

#### Example

Recommended: <https://developers.google.com/cardboard/>

Where very long URLs extend beyond a line, add a line break immediately after a
slash. Don't ever insert an extraneous hyphen into a URL to break it between two
lines.

#### Example

Recommended: <https://developers.google.com/> cardboard/

## Slashes with fractions

Don't use slashes with fractions, as they can be ambiguous.

#### Examples

In the following example, 3/4 could be interpreted either as three-quarters or
as stating that 4 is an alternative to 3.

Not recommended: 3/4

Recommended: Â¾

Recommended: 0.75
