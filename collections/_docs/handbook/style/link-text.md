# Link text

**Key Point:** Use descriptive link text that is helpful to the reader.

When you're writing link text, use a phrase that describes what the reader will
see after following the link. Links should make sense without the surrounding
text. That can take either of two forms:

- The exact title of the linked-to page, capitalized the same way the title is
  capitalized.
- A description of the linked-to page, capitalized like ordinary text instead of
  like a title.

Sometimes you have to rework a sentence to include a phrase that makes good link
text.

For more suggestions about best practices for link text, see the article at
Webcredible on
[writing effective link text](http://www.webcredible.com/blog/writing-effective-link-text/)
(but ignore the "no more than four words" rule), and Jed Hartman's
[blog post on link text](https://www.kith.org/jed/2004/12/09/link-text/).

A couple of things to keep in mind about link text:

- Don't use the phrase "click here" or "this document." It's bad for
  accessibility and bad for scannability.

- Don't use a URL as link text. Instead, use the page title or a description of
  the page.

- Use an external link icon to indicate that the link opens in a new window or
  tab. For more information, see
  [External link icons](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:External_link_icons).

- If a link downloads a file, the link text needs to indicate this action as
  well as the file type.

documents), it's okay to use URLs as link text.
