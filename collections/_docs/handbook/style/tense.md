# Present tense

**Key Point:** Avoid _will_.

In general, use present tense rather than future tense; in particular, try to
avoid using _will_ where possible. For example:

Not recommended: Send a query to the service. The server will send an
acknowledgment.

Recommended: Send a query to the service. The server sends an acknowledgment.

Sometimes, of course, future tense is unavoidable because you're actually
talking about the future. (For example: "The hedgehog will hibernate starting in
October.") [Attempting to predict the future in a document](future.md) is
usually a bad idea, but sometimes it's necessary.

But the fact that the reader will be writing and running code in the future
isn't a good reason to use future tense. Stick with present tense where
possible, as shown in the "Recommended" example above.

Also avoid the hypothetical future _would_. For example:

Not recommended: You can send an unsubscribe message. The server would then
remove you from the mailing list.

Recommended: If you send an unsubscribe message, the server removes you from the
mailing list.
