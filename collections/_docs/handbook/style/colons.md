## Bold and Italic Text Preceding Colons

When non-italic (_roman_) text that precedes a colon is bold, the colon should
not be made bold, italic, or otherwise (color-stylized, etc.).

## Code Text Preceding Colons

When text that precedes a colon is tagged as `<code>`, don't include the colon
in the `<code>` tagging unless it is part of the code. For more information
about formatting code, see [Some specific items to put in code font][].

## Colons Within Sentences

In general, the first word in the text that follows a colon should be in
lowercase. For exceptions, see [capitalization][].

<strong>Examples</strong>

<p class="example">
  <span class="compare-better">Recommended:</span> Tone: concise,
  conversational, friendly, respectful
</p>
<p class="example">
  <span class="compare-better">Recommended:</span> When you add or update
  content to an existing project, remember to take these steps: review the style
  guide, use checklists, enlist a fellow writer or an editor to copyedit your
  work, and request a developmental edit if you feel it's warranted.
