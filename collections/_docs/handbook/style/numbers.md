# Numbers

**Key Point:** Spell out whole numbers from zero through nine.

For information about formatting quantities like 10 MB, see
[Units of measurement](units-of-measure.md).

## Ordinal numbers

Spell out all ordinal numbers in text.

#### Examples

Not recommended: 1st, 5th, 12th, 43rd

Recommended: first, fifth, twelfth, forty-third

## Numbers as words

In general, spell out the following:

- Numbers from zero through nine, except as noted below in
  [Numbers as numerals](numbers.md#numbers-as-numerals).

- A number that starts a sentence.

  Recommended: Fifteen directories are created.

  In some cases it's better to rearrange the sentence so that the number appears
  later.

  Not recommended: 164 MB is generally considered too large a file to send as an
  attachment.

  Recommended: In general, avoid sending files larger than 164 MB as
  attachments.

  **Exception:** It's okay, but non-optimal, to begin a sentence with a
  four-digit year.

- A number that is followed by a numeral.

  Recommended: This procedure creates fifteen 100,000-byte files.

  _But_

  Recommended: This procedure creates 15 of the 100,000-byte files.

- Indefinite and casual numbers.

  Recommended: You can specify thousands of combinations.

  Recommended: The API might return a list of a million songs.

## Numbers as numerals

In general, use numerals for the following:

- Numbers 10 and greater.

  **Exceptions:** Always use numerals for the following items, even if they're
  less than 10:

  - Version numbers.
  - Technical quantities, such as amounts of memory, amounts of disk space,
    numbers of queries, or usage limits.
  - Page numbers.
  - Chapter numbers, sections, pages, and so on.
  - Prices.
  - Numbers without units, such as numbers used in mathematical expressions.

- Numbers less than 10 when they appear in the same sentence with numbers
  greater than 9.

  Recommended: The menu contains 15 options but 6 of them are disabled.

- Negative numbers.

- Most [fractions](numbers.md#fractions).

- [Percentages](numbers.md#percentages).

- [Dimensions](numbers.md#dimensions).

- Decimals.

  - For decimal numbers less than one, place a zero in front of the decimal
    point.

    Recommended: 0.3 inch

- Measurements.

- [Numbers in a range](numbers.md#ranges-of-numbers).

## Fractions

- Express fractions as decimal numbers, when possible.
- When expressing fractions as words, connect the numerator and denominator with
  a hyphen unless one of them is already hyphenated.

  Recommended: two-fifths

  Recommended: five sixty-fourths

## Percentages

In general, use numerals and the percent sign (%), without a space between them.

**Exception:** If the percentage starts the sentence, then spell out both the
number and the word _percent_.

Recommended: Forty percent of the files

## Ranges of numbers

Use numerals for ranges.

In theory, the correct punctuation for a range of numbers is an en dash. But in
practice, for simplicity we use a hyphen with no space either side of it.

Recommended: 2012-2016

See also the [Hyphens](hyphens.md#number-range) page.

## Currency

Make sure it's clear what country's currency you are describing. See the
currency section in [Units of measurement](units-of-measure.md#currency).

For US dollars, use a comma to delineate the thousands place of whole currency.
Use a period to delineate whole currency and fractions of currency. Always
include the dollar sign (\$) at the beginning of the currency. Do not use any
punctuation or spaces to the right of the decimal.

Not recommended: The price is \$0.006,653 per vCPU hour.

Recommended: The price is \$0.006653 per vCPU hour.

Not recommended: \$10 000 in fees is out of reach for many developers.

Recommended: \$10,000 in fees is out of reach for many developers.

## Commas and decimal points in numbers

Use commas and decimal points in accordance with standard American
number-formatting.

Specifically: in numbers four or more digits long, use commas to set off groups
of three digits, counting leftward from the decimal point, in the standard
American style. For long decimal numbers, do not use any digit-group separators
to the right of the decimal point.

**Note:** Even though the
[International System of Units](https://www.nist.gov/pml/nist-guide-si-chapter-10-more-printing-and-using-symbols-and-numbers-scientific-and-technical#1053)
(SI) uses a thin space as a digit group separator, we use a comma, which is the
most common digit group separator used in the US.

Use a period for a decimal point, also in the standard American style.

#### Examples of comma grouping

Not recommended: The limit is 1532784 bytes per day.

Recommended: The limit is 1,532,784 bytes per day.

Not recommended: The API supports up to 2000 vertices.

Recommended: The API supports up to 2,000 vertices.

Not recommended: \$0.031 611/vCPU hour

Recommended: \$0.031611/vCPU hour

**Note:** Even though in some scientific writing, four-digit numbers don't use
commas, our style is to use a comma for a four-digit number.

For more about decimal points and digit group separators, see Wikipedia's
[decimal mark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark) entry.

## Dimensions

Use numerals for dimensions.

Use a lowercase _x_ between the numerals in the dimensions, with no space
between the numerals and the _x_.

Not recommended: 192 x 192

Recommended: 192x192

**Note:** If it's important that a line break not cause a number to be separated
from the noun it modifies, use a nonbreaking space between the number and the
noun.
