# Notes, cautions, warnings, and other notices

To give the reader important or useful information that isn't part of the flow
of the text, use one of the following notice types:

Note

An ordinary note or tip.

Caution

Suggests proceeding with caution.

Warning

Stronger than a Caution; it means "Don't do this."

Success

Describes a successful action or an error-free status. Used only in interactive
or dynamic content; don't use in ordinary static pages.

Where possible, avoid grouping two or more notices together. If you find it
necessary to do so (for example, a note with a caution inside it, or several
warnings one after another), consider re-organizing the content.

## Visual presentation and code

Use whatever visual presentation for notices is standard for your site.

If youâ€™re writing in HTML and your site doesn't specify what HTML to use for
notices, we recommend using HTML code similar to the following example:

<aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> All VPC networks include firewall
rules.</aside>

## Examples

**Note:** All VPC networks include firewall rules.

**Caution:** After you delete a bucket, you can't recover archived object
versions.

**Warning:** Do not manually edit or delete generated table entries.
