# Possessives

**Key Point:** To form a singular possessive, add an apostrophe-_s_.

In general, to form a possessive of a singular noun (regardless of whether it
ends in _s_) or a plural noun that doesn't end in _s_, add _'s_ to the end of
the word. For a plural noun that does end in _s_, add an apostrophe but no
additional _s_.

#### Examples of correct possessives

- alias's
- application's
- business's
- class's
- customer's
- Elvis's
- Liz's
- user's (singular); users' (plural)
- Elise Williams's
- the Williamses'
- women's

#### Examples of incorrect possessives

- businesses's
- Buzz'
- Carlos'
- class'
- examples's
- users's
- values's

**Exception:** The possessive of _it_ is a special case because it doesn't take
an apostrophe.

Recommended as possessive: Each component has its own set of traits.

However, the contraction of "it is" takes an apostrophe.

Recommended as contraction: It's preferable when accuracy isn't as important.

## Company- and product-name possessives

To form the possessive of a company name, add _'s_ to the end of the name. Avoid
forming a possessive with a product name, regardless of who owns the product
name.
