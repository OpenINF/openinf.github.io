# Footnotes

**Key Point:** Avoid footnotes

A footnote is an annotation with additional information usually provided at the
end of a page, chapter, or book. We recommend avoiding footnotes because they
aren't accessible and can present challenges for localization efforts.

Instead of a footnote, consider using the following formats to convey
information:

- [Add a link](link-text.md).
- [Use a note](notices.md).
- [Put it in a parenthetical](parentheses.md).

If the only way to convey this information is to use a footnote, then use a
symbol instead of a number. Use symbols in the following order:

- \*
- †
- ‡
- \#

Not recommended: You want to add a footnote to this sentence.<sup>1</sup>

Better: You want to add a footnote to this sentence.\*

\* Put this footnote at the bottom of the page.
