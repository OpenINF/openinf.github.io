# Text-formatting summary

The page summarizes, and provides a quick reference for, many of the general
text-formatting conventions covered elsewhere in the style guide.

Bold

Use bold formatting, `<b>` or `**`, for [UI elements](ui-elements.md#formatting)
and at the beginning of [notices](notices.md).

Italic

Use italics formatting, `<i>` or `_`, when drawing attention to a specific word
or phrase, such as when [defining terms](formatting-key-terms.md) or
[using words as words](formatting-words-as-words.md).

Italicize titles of books, movies, and other full-length works. For more
information, see [cross-references](url-links.md).

Italicize parameter names. For example, when you refer to the parameters of a
method like `doSomething(Uri data, int count)`, italicize _data_ and _count_.

Do not use italics for emphasis in HTML. Instead, use `<em>`. For Markdown, you
can still use `_` because Markdown doesn't allow semantic tagging.

Underline

Do not underline.

Code font

Use [semantic HTML](semantic-tagging.md) and use code font, `<code>` or `` ` ``,
to apply a monospace font and other styling to [code in text](code-in-text.md),
inline code, and user input.

Use code blocks, `<pre>` or ` ``` `, for [code samples](code-samples.md) or
other blocks of code.

Do not override or modify font styles inline.

Use code font to mark up most things that have anything to do with code, such as
class names, method names, HTTP status codes, and placeholder variables.

Sentence case and capitalization

Use American English style for [general capitalization](capitalization.md). Use
sentence case in all
[headings, titles, and navigation](capitalization#capitalization-in-titles-and-headings.md).

Quotation marks

In general, use American English style when
[punctuating quotations](quotation-marks.md).

For titles of shorter works, such as articles, put titles in quotation marks,
unless it's part of a link.

Font type, size, and color

Do not override global styles for [font type, size, or color](fonts.md).

Use [semantic HTML](semantic-tagging.md) to control the style of text on a page.
For example, use code tags, `<code>` or `` ` ``, instead of manually styling
text with a monospace font.

Other punctuation conventions

Don't use [ampersands (&)](word-list.md#ampersand) as conjunctions or shorthand
for _and_. Use _and_ instead. That includes headings and navigation.
**Exception:** It's okay to use _&_ in cases where you need to refer to a UI
element or the name of a menu that uses _&_.

Put quotation marks and end punctuation
[outside of link text](link-text#punctuation-with-links.md).
