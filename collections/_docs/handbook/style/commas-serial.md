# Commas

**Key Point:** Use commas to separate items in series, and use commas to
separate certain kinds of clauses.

## Serial commas

In a series of three or more items, use a comma before the final "and" or "or."

#### Examples

Not recommended: I dedicate this book to my parents, Ayn Rand and God.

Recommended: I dedicate this book to my parents, Ayn Rand, and God.

## Commas after introductory words and phrases

In general, place a comma after an introductory word or phrase.

#### Examples

Recommended: Finally, only groups that contain parameters appear in this list.

Recommended: Based on the requirements of your game, you can implement this
method to update game information.

## Commas separating two independent clauses

When a coordinating conjunction (_and_, _but_, _or_, _nor_, _for_, _so_, or
_yet_) separates two independent clauses, insert a comma after the first clause
(before the conjunction) unless both clauses are very short.

#### Examples

Not recommended: The libraries not only make feed creation easier but they also
ensure that only valid feeds are produced.

Recommended: The libraries not only make feed creation easier, but they also
ensure that only valid feeds are produced.

Not recommended: Type your ID, and click **OK**.

Recommended: Type your ID and click **OK**.

## Commas separating independent from dependent clauses

When an independent clause and a dependent clause are separated by a
coordinating conjunction, insert a comma _only if_ the sentence could be
misunderstood without one.

#### Examples

Not recommended: Direct-access flags are plain variables, and can be read
directly.

Recommended: Direct-access flags are plain variables and can be read directly.

Not recommended: The manager acknowledged the last team member who entered the
room and started the meeting.

Recommended: The manager acknowledged the last team member who entered the room,
and started the meeting.

## Setting off other kinds of clauses

It's often a good idea to set off certain kinds of clauses with a comma or other
punctuation, for clarity.

A couple of specific places where commas are a good idea:

- In general, put a comma before the word "which" at the start of a
  nonrestrictive clause. For more on this topic, see this guide's section on
  [relative pronouns](pronouns.md#relative-pronouns), and Grammar Girl's page on
  [which vs that](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/which-versus-that-0?page=all).
- In general, put a semicolon or a period or a dash before a conjunctive adverb,
  such as "otherwise" or "however" or "therefore," and put a comma after the
  conjunctive adverb.

#### Examples

Not recommended: Name of the group which has a maximum length of 200 characters.

Recommended: Name of the group, which has a maximum length of 200 characters.

And:

Not recommended: The variable must have a value otherwise the server returns an
error.

Recommended: The variable must have a value; otherwise, the server returns an
error.
