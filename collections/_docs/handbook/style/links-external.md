# Linking to other sites

**Key Point:** It's fine to link to a third-party site for more information.

Our documentation often relies on the reader knowing something about third-party
standards or software. In such cases, it's better to link to good documentation
elsewhere than to try to thoroughly document someone else's standard in our
documentation.

On the other hand, sometimes a few sentences of basic information can save
readers a trip to an external site. For example, our API docsets have
traditionally included a brief explanation of REST. As knowledge of REST becomes
more widespread, we might be able to assume that readers already know about it,
and can remove those brief explanations.

Another example: if you want to mention one HTTP status code, then describing it
in your document might make sense. If you want to make sure that your reader
understands the idea of HTTP status codes, and knows what several of them mean,
then linking them to an external document (such as the HTTP spec) might be a
good idea.

There may also be contexts in which we're talking about third-party tools or
products (a library for a particular language, say, or a useful and relevant
utility); there again, it's fine to link to the relevant site.

But make sure any site you link to is high-quality, reliable, and respectable.

Link to the most relevant page on a site. Link to the most relevant heading on a
page.

If the URL has a locale indicator, remove it and then test the link. For
example, in a Wikipedia link, change the following:

<https://**en.**wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level\_virtualization>

to this:

<https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level\_virtualization>

Use an [external link icon](url-links.md#out-page) to indicate that the link
opens in a new window or tab.
