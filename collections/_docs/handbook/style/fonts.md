# Fonts and font size

**Key Point:** Use the standard fonts and CSS for the site you're publishing on.

In general, don't change the font or font size in your document, except by using
the standard CSS for the site you're publishing on, or by using
[semantic tags](semantic-tagging.md). In particular, don't use the `<font>` tag.
