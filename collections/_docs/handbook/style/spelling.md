# Spelling

**Key Point:** Use standard American spelling.

In general, in cases where American spelling differs from Commonwealth/"British"
spelling, use the American spelling.

When in doubt about the spelling of a word, first see the
[word list](word-list.md); if it's not covered there, then see
[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Eleventh Edition](http://www.merriam-webster.com/).
(Abbreviated as "MW11.")

Spellings that are nonstandard in the US (and thus shouldn't be used in
Google-related documentation) are marked in MW11 as "chiefly British."

A contrived example:

Not recommended: Practise sorting a tonne of aluminium by colour; authorise the
centre to give the armoury a licence for manoeuvres; measure in kilogrammes and
kilometres; it behoves you to accessorise your kerbs.

Recommended: Practice sorting a ton of aluminum by color; authorize the center
to give the armory a license for maneuvers; measure in kilograms and kilometers;
it behooves you to accessorize your curbs.

Although non-American readers tend to be tolerant of _reading_ American spelling
in technical documentation, they may find it difficult to have to _type_
American spelling. For example, if your documentation tells a reader who's used
to the spelling `colour` to type `color`, they may mistype it. So when you use
filenames, URLs, and data parameters in examples, try to avoid words that are
spelled differently by different groups of English speakers.

**Note:** There are some spellings that some Americans tend to think of as
British but that are common in the US. In particular, words with "-lling" and
"-lled" endings (travelling, travelled) are acceptable American spellings
according to MW11; likewise "theatre," "aesthetic," "axe," "catalogue," and
others. More generally, there are lots of words that have multiple acceptable
spellings.

A couple of additional resources, though these are not definitive:

- The
  [spelling section](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Spelling)
  of Wikipedia's manual of style includes a useful table showing spelling
  differences for some common words in seven countries.
- [UK vs US spelling](http://www.tysto.com/articles05/q1/20050324uk-us.shtml): a
  list of over 1700 differences. Very useful, but several of the listed UK
  spellings are common in the US, and the list omits at least one difference and
  contains at least one typo.
