# Windows Server Workstation Setup

This section deals with preparing devices for (and installing) Windows Server as
the host OS for modern software development workstations.

Although using Windows may not be a requirement for contributions, many have
made the conscious decision not to go with the more common locked-down option of
Apple products. Oftentimes, the hardware associated with the machine has the
most compatibility with drivers specifically made for Windows while Linux driver
support may be limited or non-existent in some cases.

Windows as a software development workstation using one of the "Home" or
"Professional" offerings has been a notoriously bad decision due to unexpected
updates forcing the reboot at inconvenient times and which is something that the
Server offerings are more prepared to avoid having this happen.

Of the Windows Server offerings, the Desktop Experience varietal is the only
feasible choice as dealing with multimedia is often involved.

Refer to the [Get started with Windows Server][] article to learn more about how
to go about acquiring and installing it on your (hopefully) compatible system.
Regardless of stated minimum system requirements, no less than 16gb of RAM would
be recommended.
