# Contributor Roles and Responsibilities

Want to contribute? Great! First, read this document, which is a set of
guidelines to help you contribute to this project.

Whether you're finding bugs, adding new capabilities, fixing anything broken, or
improving documentation, get started by submitting an issue or pull request.

This project uses the following tools to organize discussion.

- **Issue tracker:** For discussing issues related to the project.
- **Pull requests:** For discussing and reviewing changes that are in progress.
- **Synchronous chat channel:** For casual conversation, collaboration, quick
  exchanges, and questions.

## Issue tracker

If you've found a bug, would like to request a new feature or make a proposal,
file an [issue][]!

### Resolving open issues

We track ongoing endeavors via the GitHub issues associated with each
repository, and that’s where you can find tasks to undertake. First, check the
labels on the issue you're interested in.

- Issues labeled _help wanted_ or _good first issue_ have been identified as
  desirable for community contribution. Feel free to work on GFIs even if not
  your first issue.
  - List of [all issues labeled _good first issue_][i-gfi]
  - List of [all issues labeled _help wanted_][i-help]
  - List of [all incomplete pull requests labeled _help wanted_][pr-help]
- If the issue does not have either of those labels, it may still be open for
  contribution.
- Issues labeled _work in progress_ are generally not available, but may be
  available if there has been no activity on the issue or related PR for over a
  week.

Once you have identified an issue you would like to work on, follow these steps:

1.  Comment on it and say you would like to work on that issue.
2.  Wait for someone to confirm that you may work on the issue before writing
    any code. The person who confirms will add a _work in progress_ label to the
    issue to indicate that the issue has been assigned.
3.  Once the issue has been labeled as a _work in progress_, write your code and
    submit your PR.
4.  Wait for code review and address any issues raised as soon as you can.

Even if you are not done with the issue, create a [draft pull request][] and
push your code [early and often][]. If we haven't heard from you in over a week
and someone else expresses interest in that issue, we may approve the new
person's work.

### Opening a new issue

If you want to work on something that there is no GitHub issue for, then propose
the change by opening a new GitHub issue associated with the respective
repository and propose your change there. Be sure to include implementation
details and the rationale for the proposed change.

## Pull requests

If you'd like to propose and collaborate on changes, open a [pull request][]!

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of having
your pull request merged:

- Follow standards for style and code quality.
- Write tests when applicable.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you
  would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting
  them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message][].
