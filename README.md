_The high-level goal of open.inf.is is to build and maintain a current website
serving content and assets. Although this site is still in its infancy, it’s
intended to support separation of concerns. As is the case with any software
project in continuous development, omissions and errors may exist, for which
contributions are welcome._

Short-term non-goals:

- Use an environment different from `github-pages`

Long-term non-goals:

- Use `github-pages` or their static site generator

<br />

The rationale for this approach is that we would like our website code suspended
on this framework initially. It has a good form and structure, yet, due to the
underlying technologies (`scss` & `html+liquid`) being of limited power,
evolution becomes necessary while retaining the same codebase layout.
