_The high-level goal of open.inf.is is to build and maintain a current website
serving content and assets. Although this site is still in its infancy, itâ€™s
intended to support separation of concerns. As is the case with any software
project in continuous development, omissions and errors may exist, for which
contributions are welcome._

Short-term non-goals:

- Use an environment different from `github-pages`

Long-term non-goals:

- Use `github-pages` or their static site generator

<br />

The rationale for this approach is that we would like our website code suspended
on this framework initially. It has a good form and structure, yet, due to the
underlying technologies (`scss` & `html+liquid`) being of limited power,
evolution becomes necessary while retaining the same codebase layout.
