_The high-level goal of open.inf.is is to build and maintain a current website serving content and assets. Although this site is currently experimental,
its employment has become necessary to solve for use cases that were, judging by outstanding user needs, been deemed necessary for separation of concerns.
As is the case with any software project in continuous development, omissions and errors may exist, for which contributions are welcome!_
