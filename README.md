<br />

The high-level goal of this project is to build and maintain a community portal
that serves content and assets. Although this portal is still in its infancy, it
is intended to support a separation of concerns between hosting our community
website, SDK documentation, and more. We are constantly working to improve this
work, so please feel free to contribute if you notice any omissions or errors.

Thanks!

### License

It is essential always to read the license for all code and content in question.
Each source code and content directory typically contains the appropriate
license file(s) for that directory's source code and/or content. The code and
content files themselves also typically contain licensing and authorship
metadata.

Most of the repository's source code is permissively licensed under MIT, Apache
2.0, or Blue Oak 1.0.0. The IDK reference documentation content uses the CC
BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, while the embedded source code snippets and examples use
the public domain equivalent 0BSD license. The collection of documents
comprising our style guide handbook uses the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.
